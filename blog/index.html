              If you're reading this then you've found my blog by solving my puzzle - well done! That is a truly impressive display of effort, most people would never invest so much time into a website (hence why I only let those truly worthy find my blog).
            </p>
            <p>
              It would certainly be unfair for you to get all the way here and get no reward. So, consider yourself now in possession of a favour. A favour that you can ask from me at any time. Just say "the puzzle master needs a favour" in your text, email, voice message or in-person request and I will do whatever you ask (within reason). From recording a personal cooking lesson to lighting a fart on fire, I challenge you to get something worthwhile out of me. Oh, and you only get one!
            </p>
            <p>
              Congratulations once again and thank you for spending the time to solve my simple puzzle, I had a lot of fun making it for you. You're now (obviously) on my blog page, feel free to invade my privacy to your heart's content but most importantly, have a lovely day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your friend,
            </p>
