# This website!

Built with [Bootstrap](bootstrap.com) (+jQuery & Popper), [Bootswatch](bootswatch.com) (Minty theme üçÉ) & [Eleventy](11ty.dev) in one solid 14-hour session. Stoked.

What do you think of it? Hit the email button in the menu to send me any much appreciated thoughts üß°

## Why Bootstrap + 11ty?

I'll start with Bootstrap: Because I have built many website layouts from scratch in the past but there has always been something just a little not-quite-right-feeling about them. They've been good don't get me wrong (check out [theEmpire](theempire.dev) ü§ì) just not reliably good. And so after using the Gatsby Serif Business template in a project recently and feeling the power of modifying a prebuilt template I was drawn to repeat the process. Ultimately it's a massive boost to start from a template language and/or prebuilt design than from scratch but also I find working from a well-designed template can help keep me in line (I'm not a trained desinger) while also allowing my creativity to come by extending/modifying the starting point. 

The CSS file I started with (thanks Bootswatch) has received a few little tweaks and modifications and I'm not using a large deal of standard bootstrap components. But when I want to stick in some breadcrumbs for example, I can use the bootstrap component then tweak a couple settings and have my ideal breakcrumbs set-up in a matter of minutes! The risk with Bootstrap in this project is that it could have made the site look a bit 2016. However I think (/hope) I've managed to steer away from that.

Okay so, moving on to the cool kid on the block... Eleventy (/11ty?)! 11ty was super fun to use because it took me out of the React paradigm I have been locked in for years. I love React but a man needs something new once in a while! For those who don't know, [React](reactjs.org/) is an extremely popular Javascript library for building web applications. [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) then came along and gave us a wonderful static-site-gneration tooll (big work, ignore if necessary) which could've have very well been the tool used to make this blog. But it wasn't and thank god for that. 

I will maybe write a blog post about why 11ty was a dream for me compared to Gatsby but I won't go into detail now. Long story short, 11ty gives you so much more freedom in how to use it as well as keeping itself simple. It just makes more inutive sense to me compared to React / Gatsby that require a deep understanding of the React framework as well as Server-Side-Rendering (ooh another big scary word to ignore). But really, the reason I used 11ty was because an old friend once recommended it to me and I never forgot. So thanks Adam, you rock.

## Conclusion 

I have needed a good portfolio site for a while and now I have one! The file structure is nice, the dependencies are small and the code is okay... üòÖ If you'd like to see the source you can on [GitHub](github.com/sejroi/thesebsite). However, the difference between the built site and the source code is pretty small so you could just right click and inspect. That's just another perk of 11ty! Hopefully there will be much more good to come of this site. For now, chill and bed. It's been a day.
